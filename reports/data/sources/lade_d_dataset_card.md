# 1. About Dataset
**LaDe** is a  publicly available last-mile delivery dataset with  millions of packages from industry. 
It has three unique characteristics:  (1) Large-scale. It involves 10,677k packages of 21k couriers over 6 months of real-world operation. 
(2) Comprehensive information, it offers original package information, such as its location and time requirements, as well as task-event information, which records when and where the courier is while events such as task-accept and task-finish events happen. 
(3) Diversity: the dataset includes data from various scenarios, such as package pick-up and delivery, and from multiple cities, each with its unique spatio-temporal patterns due to their distinct characteristics such as populations.

# 2. Download
[LaDe](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cainiao-AI/LaDe) is composed of two subdatasets: i) [LaDe-D](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cainiao-AI/LaDe-D), which comes from the package delivery scenario.
ii) [LaDe-P](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cainiao-AI/LaDe-P), which comes from the package pickup scenario. To facilitate the utilization of the dataset, each sub-dataset is presented in CSV format.

LaDe-D is the first subdataset from [LaDe](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cainiao-AI/LaDe).

LaDe can be used for research purposes. Before you download the dataset, please read these terms. And [Code link](https://github.com/wenhaomin/LaDe). Then put the data into "./data/raw/".  
The structure of "./data/raw/" should be like:  
```
* ./data/raw/  
    * delivery    
        * delivery_sh.csv   
        * ...    
```

LaDe-D contains 5 files, with each representing the data from a specific city,  the detail of each city can be find in the following table.
